Diving into the world of image processing was like unlocking a treasure chest of cool techniques and tools. It really opened my eyes to how you can transform a simple photo into something stunning. I enjoy taking pictures, and this was a great experience to learn editing tools that I can use to enhance my pictures. The picture we used over here was taken by me. I worked with three main techniques: histogram equalization, smoothing, and sharpening, and each one taught me something new.

### Histogram Equalization
The first technique I used is called histogram equalization. Basically, it’s all about adjusting the contrast by redistributing the light and dark areas more evenly across the image. When I applied histogram equalization to my butterfly photo, the colors popped, and all those hidden details came to life. It made me realize how important contrast is in making an image look balanced and vibrant.

### Smoothing
Next, I tackled smoothing, which is used for reducing noise. We know that the picture comes with some amount to a lot of grains that can mess up a photo, especially in low light. Smoothing helps get rid of those by softening the picture. When I applied it to my image, everything looked much cleaner. But I also learned that you have to be careful not to overdo it. It’s about finding the right balance.

### Sharpening
Finally, I worked with sharpening, which is about making the details stand out by emphasizing the edges. When I used sharpening on the butterfly picture, the wings and body became so much more detailed. Too much sharpening can create weird halos around the edges and make the image look unnatural. The key lesson here is subtlety.

### Key Lessons
Throughout this whole process, one theme kept coming up: balance. Whether it was adjusting contrast, reducing noise, or enhancing details, finding the right balance was crucial. And one of the most important things I learned was the value of non-destructive editing. It’s a best practice in image processing because it lets you experiment without losing the original quality.

### Broader Applications
This journey wasn’t just about making pretty pictures. These techniques are used everywhere – from photography and semiconductor industries to medical imaging. These tasks require complex image transformations, filtering, and enhancements. For example, in the medical field, these imaging techniques are crucial for things like MRI scans and X-rays, helping to reveal important details that can save lives.

### Conclusion
Overall, this quest into the fundamentals of image processing was incredibly rewarding. It gave me a deeper understanding of how techniques like histogram equalization, smoothing, and sharpening can dramatically enhance image quality. Each technique taught me valuable lessons about balance, subtlety, and the importance of non-destructive editing. Whether it is for photography, industrial applications, or medical imaging, these foundational techniques are essential tools for anyone working with images.

# FINAL EXAM
# AI Agent for Flappy Bird

## Project Overview
This project aims to train an AI agent to play Flappy Bird using computer vision and reinforcement learning. The agent learns to navigate the game by interacting with the environment, maximizing its score while avoiding obstacles.

## Environment Setup

### Game Environment
Flappy Bird is a simple 2D side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. The bird is affected by gravity, causing it to fall unless the player taps the screen to flap. The scoring system increases the score by one point for each set of pipes successfully passed.

### Libraries and Tools
- **PyGame**: A library for creating 2D games in Python, used to recreate the Flappy Bird environment.
- **OpenAI Gym**: A toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms, providing a standard API for interacting with the game environment.

### State Representation
The game state is represented by frames captured at each time step, including the bird's position, velocity, and the positions of the nearest pipes. The action space consists of two actions: flap (to ascend) or do nothing.

## Pre-trained Model Usage

### Transfer Learning
Transfer learning is used to leverage a pre-trained model, reducing training time and improving performance. This approach allows the model to utilize learned features from related tasks.

### Model Choice
I selected **MobileNetV2** for its efficiency and performance in image classification tasks. The convolutional layers of the model are used to extract features from game frames, which are then fed into the reinforcement learning algorithm. 

## Reinforcement Learning Implementation

### Basics
- **States**: Processed game frames representing the environment.
- **Actions**: Possible moves the agent can make (flap or do nothing).
- **Rewards**: Feedback from the environment, such as score increments or penalties.
- **Policies**: Strategies the agent uses to decide actions based on states.

### Algorithm Choice
I implemented a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** algorithm, which combines Q-learning with deep neural networks to handle high-dimensional input spaces. Key components include:
- Q-network architecture for approximating the Q-value function.
- Replay memory for training stability.
- Target network for stable target values during training.

### Exploration-Exploitation
An epsilon-greedy policy was used to balance exploration and exploitation. The agent explores with a probability ε and exploits with a probability 1-ε, gradually decreasing ε over time.

### Experience Replay
I implemented experience replay by storing experiences in a replay buffer and sampling mini-batches for training, improving stability and efficiency.

## Model Training

### Training Process
1. Initialize the Q-network and target network.
2. Set up replay memory.
3. For each episode:
   - Start the game and initialize the state.
   - For each time step:
     - Select an action using the epsilon-greedy policy.
     - Execute the action and observe the reward and next state.
     - Store the experience in replay memory.
     - Sample a mini-batch from replay memory.
     - Perform a gradient descent step on the loss derived from the Bellman equation.
     - Update the target network periodically.

### Hyperparameters
I tuned hyperparameters such as learning rate, discount factor (γ), epsilon decay rate, mini-batch size, and replay memory size using grid search.

### Handling Training Issues
- **Catastrophic Forgetting**: Addressed using target network updates and replay memory.
- **Reward Sparsity**: Implemented reward shaping for more frequent feedback.

### Performance Evaluation
During training, I tracked average rewards per episode, loss values, and Q-values.

## Testing and Evaluation

### Testing Strategy
I evaluated the agent's performance over multiple episodes, using metrics like average score, survival time, and the number of pipes passed.

### Result Interpretation
I compared the agent's performance against a random policy and a heuristic-based policy. Visualization tools were used to plot learning curves and analyze decision-making patterns.

## Reflections

### Learning Experience
Throughout this project, I gained insights into reinforcement learning, transfer learning, and the challenges of training AI agents in dynamic environments.

### Challenges Faced
I encountered challenges such as ensuring effective feature extraction from the pre-trained model and balancing exploration and exploitation during training.

### Future Improvements
Future work may involve exploring advanced reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., Double DQN, Dueling DQN), utilizing recurrent neural networks for state representation, and experimenting with different reward structures.

## Conclusion
This project provided a comprehensive understanding of training an AI agent using computer vision and reinforcement learning techniques. The agent successfully learns to play Flappy Bird, demonstrating the effectiveness of these approaches.
